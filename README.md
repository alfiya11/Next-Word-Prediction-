# Next-Word-Prediction-

This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using TensorFlow and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model is designed to generate the next word in a sequence based on an initial input phrase. By leveraging the capabilities of RNNs, which effectively handle sequential data, the model learns to understand the context and linguistic structure, providing contextually relevant word predictions.
